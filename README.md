# Advent of Code

This is my repository for my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). It uses Rust for all the solutions, and [just](https://github.com/casey/just) for all the scaffolding stuff.

Get your session token from AoC and have an environment variable called `AOC_SESSION` in `.env`.

Use `just get-all-inputs` to download your input files, and if you're not me, then the tests will all fail, because they test against my real input.
